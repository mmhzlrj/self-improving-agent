# Plugin Bundles

# Plugin Bundles

OpenClaw can install plugins from three external ecosystems: **Codex**, **Claude**,
and **Cursor**. These are called **bundles** — content and metadata packs that
OpenClaw maps into native features like skills, hooks, and MCP tools.

  Bundles are **not** the same as native OpenClaw plugins. Native plugins run
  in-process and can register any capability. Bundles are content packs with
  selective feature mapping and a narrower trust boundary.

## Why bundles exist

Many useful plugins are published in Codex, Claude, or Cursor format. Instead
of requiring authors to rewrite them as native OpenClaw plugins, OpenClaw
detects these formats and maps their supported content into the native feature
set. This means you can install a Claude command pack or a Codex skill bundle
and use it immediately.

## Install a bundle

    ```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}}
    # Local directory
    openclaw plugins install ./my-bundle

    # Archive
    openclaw plugins install ./my-bundle.tgz

    # Claude marketplace
    openclaw plugins marketplace list 
    openclaw plugins install @
    ```

    ```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}}
    openclaw plugins list
    openclaw plugins inspect 
    ```

    Bundles show as `Format: bundle` with a subtype of `codex`, `claude`, or `cursor`.

    ```bash  theme={"theme":{"light":"min-light","dark":"min-dark"}}
    openclaw gateway restart
    ```

    Mapped features (skills, hooks, MCP tools) are available in the next session.

## What OpenClaw maps from bundles

Not every bundle feature runs in OpenClaw today. Here is what works and what
is detected but not yet wired.

### Supported now

| Feature       | How it maps                                                                                          | Applies to     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Skill content | Bundle skill roots load as normal OpenClaw skills                                                    | All formats    |
| Commands      | `commands/` and `.cursor/commands/` treated as skill roots                                           | Claude, Cursor |
| Hook packs    | OpenClaw-style `HOOK.md` + `handler.ts` layouts                                                      | Codex          |
| MCP tools     | Bundle MCP config merged into embedded Pi settings; supported stdio servers launched as subprocesses | All formats    |
| Settings      | Claude `settings.json` imported as embedded Pi defaults                                              | Claude         |

### Detected but not executed

These are recognized and shown in diagnostics, but OpenClaw does not run them:

* Claude `agents`, `hooks.json` automation, `lspServers`, `outputStyles`
* Cursor `.cursor/agents`, `.cursor/hooks.json`, `.cursor/rules`
* Codex inline/app metadata beyond capability reporting

## Bundle formats

    Markers: `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`

    Optional content: `skills/`, `hooks/`, `.mcp.json`, `.app.json`

    Codex bundles fit OpenClaw best when they use skill roots and OpenClaw-style
    hook-pack directories (`HOOK.md` + `handler.ts`).

    Two detection modes:

    * **Manifest-based:** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
    * **Manifestless:** default Claude layout (`skills/`, `commands/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`, `.mcp.json`, `settings.json`)

    Claude-specific behavior:

    * `commands/` is treated as skill content
    * `settings.json` is imported into embedded Pi settings (shell override keys are sanitized)
    * `.mcp.json` exposes supported stdio tools to embedded Pi
    * `hooks/hooks.json` is detected but not executed
    * Custom component paths in the manifest are additive (they extend defaults, not replace them)

    Markers: `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`

    Optional content: `skills/`, `.cursor/commands/`, `.cursor/agents/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursor/hooks.json`, `.mcp.json`

    * `.cursor/commands/` is treated as skill content
    * `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursor/agents/`, and `.cursor/hooks.json` are detect-only

## Detection precedence

OpenClaw checks for native plugin format first:

1. `openclaw.plugin.json` or valid `package.json` with `openclaw.extensions` — treated as **native plugin**
2. Bundle markers (`.codex-plugin/`, `.claude-plugin/`, or default Claude/Cursor layout) — treated as **bundle**

If a directory contains both, OpenClaw uses the native path. This prevents
dual-format packages from being partially installed as bundles.

## Security

Bundles have a narrower trust boundary than native plugins:

* OpenClaw does **not** load arbitrary bundle runtime modules in-process
* Skills and hook-pack paths must stay inside the plugin root (boundary-checked)
* Settings files are read with the same boundary checks
* Supported stdio MCP servers may be launched as subprocesses

This makes bundles safer by default, but you should still treat third-party
bundles as trusted content for the features they do expose.

## Troubleshooting

    Run `openclaw plugins inspect `. If a capability is listed but marked as
    not wired, that is a product limit — not a broken install.

    Make sure the bundle is enabled and the markdown files are inside a detected
    `commands/` or `skills/` root.

    Only embedded Pi settings from `settings.json` are supported. OpenClaw does
    not treat bundle settings as raw config patches.

    `hooks/hooks.json` is detect-only. If you need runnable hooks, use the
    OpenClaw hook-pack layout or ship a native plugin.
